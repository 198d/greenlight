Greenlight
==========

This library provides an _integration testing_ framework for Clojure. Running
a suite of tests against your systems gives you the confidence to _greenlight_
them for promotion to production. The primary goals of this framework are:

- Steps should be _composable_ to drive down repetition in similar tests.
- Tests should be _distributable_ and support parallelization out-of-the-box.
- Results should be _actionable_ and easy to understand.
